He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.[5]</p>  <p>After directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola&#39;s reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre,[6] and was adored by the public and critics alike. The Godfather won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo).</p>  <p>The Godfather Part II, which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to be so honored three times for the same film. The Conversation, which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d&#39;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, Apocalypse Now (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. The film won the Palme d&#39;Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.</p>  <p>His best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), the crime dramas The Cotton Club (1984) and The Godfather Part III (1990), and the horror film Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula (1992). A number of Coppola&#39;s relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress Talia Shire; his daughter Sofia Coppola and granddaughter Gia Coppola are directors, and the actors Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are his nephews.

and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer&#39;s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#39;s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets&#39; drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including &quot;Easy Reader&quot;, &quot;Mel Mounds&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot; on the Children&#39;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children&#39;s adventure, Who Says I Can&#39;t Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Driving Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.</p>", "content_source": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm", "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n45R0eF1ctc", "trailer_info": "", "image": "celebs/30/morgan-freeman_________-zcek6.jpg", "image_credit": "@wikimedia", "duties": [4, 2]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 31, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-22T12:06:22.195Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "neil-giuntoli-9kucr", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Neil Giuntoli", "first_name": "Neil", "last_name": "Giuntoli", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "birthdate": null, "birth_place": "", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 32, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-22T12:06:22.263Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "scott-glenn-3r9gp", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Scott Glenn", "first_name": "Scott", "last_name": "Glenn", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "birthdate": null, "birth_place": "", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 33, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-22T12:06:22.330Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "david-s-goyer-12vco", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "David S.

Through his career spanning over thirty years in Hindi films, Khan has established himself as one of the most popular and influential actors of Indian cinema.[2][3] He has a large global following, especially in India and China, and has been described by Newsweek as &quot;the biggest movie star&quot;[4][5] in the world.[6][7][8] Khan is the recipient of numerous awards, including nine Filmfare Awards, four National Film Awards, and an AACTA Award. He was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Shri in 2003 and the Padma Bhushan in 2010,[9] and received an honorary title from the Government of China in 2017.[10] For years, he has been regularly listed one among the 500 Most Influential Muslims of the world.[11][12]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khan first appeared on screen as a child actor in his uncle Nasir Hussain&#39;s film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973).

His ten films have grossed over US$4.7 billion worldwide and garnered a total of 34 Oscar nominations and ten wins. Born and raised in London, Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made his feature debut with Following (1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005&ndash;2012), The Prestige (2006), and Inception (2010), which received eight Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by Interstellar (2014) and Dunkirk (2017), the latter of which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nolan&#39;s films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His work is permeated by unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife Emma Thomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nolan has received many awards and honours.
