Following a decade of leading and supporting roles, including in Little Women (1994), he gained wider recognition for portraying the serial killer Patrick Bateman in American Psycho (2000). In 2004, he lost 4 stone 7 pounds (29 kg; 63 lb) for his role in the psychological thriller The Machinist (2004). Within six months, he gained 7 stone 2 pounds (45 kg; 100 lb) to star as Batman in Christopher Nolan&#39;s superhero film Batman Begins (2005).

This acclaim continued with his Oscar-nominated roles in Russell&#39;s black comedy American Hustle (2013) and in Adam McKay&#39;s satires The Big Short (2015) and Vice (2018). For portraying Dick Cheney in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

He is well-regarded for his cultural influence on 20th-century film.[4] Brando was also an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#39; play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway.[5] He received further praise, and an Academy Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture.[6] Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#39;s 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare&#39;s Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James Michener&#39;s 1954 novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1960s saw Brando&#39;s career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather (1972). He got the part and subsequently won his second Academy Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. He refused the award due to mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris, Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles, such as in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days&#39; work on Superman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century.[7] In this list, Time also designated Brando as the &quot;Actor of the Century&quot;.</p>", "content_source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando", "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4yajZj6s5I", "trailer_info": "", "image": "celebs/9/marlon-brando_________-hvyti.jpg", "image_credit": "@wannart.com", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 10, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:57.862Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "clancy-brown-m19ql", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Clancy Brown", "birth_name": "", "first_name": "Clancy", "last_name": "Brown", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "imdb_id": "", "birthdate": "1959-01-05", "birth_place": "Urbana, Ohio, U.S.", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "death_reason": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 11, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:57.936Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "james-caan-mh8mh", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "James Caan", "birth_name": "", "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Caan", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "imdb_id": "", "birthdate": "1940-03-26", "birth_place": "The Bronx, New York, U.S.", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "death_reason": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 12, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:58.011Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "michael-caine-iq40a", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Michael Caine", "birth_name": "", "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Caine", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "imdb_id": "", "birthdate": "1933-03-14", "birth_place": "Rotherhithe, London, England", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "death_reason": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 13, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:58.083Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "dan-castellaneta-uowvt", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Dan Castellaneta", "birth_name": "", "first_name": "Dan", "last_name": "Castellaneta", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "imdb_id": "", "birthdate": "1957-10-29", "birth_place": "Chicago, Illinois, U.S.", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "death_reason": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 14, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:58.152Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "richard-s-castellano-695mv", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Richard S.

He was a central figure in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola&#39;s reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather (1972). The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre,[6] and was adored by the public and critics alike. The Godfather won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with Mario Puzo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Godfather Part II, which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after Billy Wilder) to be so honored three times for the same film. The Conversation, which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d&#39;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, Apocalypse Now (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. The film won the Palme d&#39;Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), the crime dramas The Cotton Club (1984) and The Godfather Part III (1990), and the horror film Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula (1992). A number of Coppola&#39;s relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress Talia Shire; his daughter Sofia Coppola and granddaughter Gia Coppola are directors, and the actors Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are his nephews.

Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer&#39;s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#39;s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets&#39; drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including &quot;Easy Reader&quot;, &quot;Mel Mounds&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot; on the Children&#39;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children&#39;s adventure, Who Says I Can&#39;t Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Driving Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.</p>", "content_source": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm", "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n45R0eF1ctc", "trailer_info": "", "image": "celebs/30/morgan-freeman_________-ogb0u.jpg", "image_credit": "@wikimedia", "duties": [2, 4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 31, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:59.601Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "neil-giuntoli-ctm3z", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Neil Giuntoli", "birth_name": "", "first_name": "Neil", "last_name": "Giuntoli", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "imdb_id": "", "birthdate": null, "birth_place": "", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "death_reason": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 32, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:59.681Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "scott-glenn-jgxlp", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "Scott Glenn", "birth_name": "", "first_name": "Scott", "last_name": "Glenn", "nick_name": "", "is_featured": false, "imdb_id": "", "birthdate": null, "birth_place": "", "deathdate": null, "death_place": "", "death_reason": "", "content": "", "content_source": "", "trailer": "", "trailer_info": "", "image": "", "image_credit": "", "duties": [4]}}, {"model": "celebs.celebrity", "pk": 33, "fields": {"added_at": "2020-06-29T23:22:59.764Z", "added_by": 1, "updated_at": null, "updated_by": null, "slug": "david-s-goyer-kwwi2", "extra_chars_count": 5, "name": "David S.
